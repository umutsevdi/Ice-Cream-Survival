Ice Cream Survival
Ice Cream Survival is my entry for Mini-Jam 66: Sweets:
This Mini Jam's theme is Sweets and there can be only two buttons used
in the whole game. During the development of the game, my friends helped
me on some things like animations, but other than that I made the programming
and art.

Survive against angry customers while trying not to melt! Move with your cursor.
And that's it. As time goes on Icecream starts to melt. To stop melting, you must
press the icecream platforms. But this only works when they are open. The longer you
play, the faster game becomes! How long will you survive?
